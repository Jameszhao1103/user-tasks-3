# Task: Add Dark Mode Toggle to Matplotlib

## Objective
Add a new functionality that allows users to toggle any existing plot to dark mode with a single function call.

## Requirements
1. Create a new function called `toggle_dark_mode(ax=None, fig=None)` that:
   - Can be applied to either a specific axis, a figure, or the current figure if none is specified
   - Converts the plot background to a dark color (e.g., #121212)
   - Inverts text colors from dark to light
   - Adjusts plot elements (grid lines, tick marks, etc.) to be visible on dark background
   - Preserves the original colors of data elements (lines, points, bars) or provides an option to adjust them for better visibility
2. The function should be reversible (calling it again should toggle back to light mode)
3. Create a simple demo script showing the functionality in action
